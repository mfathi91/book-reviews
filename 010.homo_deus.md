Homo Deus shows the path where Homo Sapiens began, what we have achieved, and where we are probably heading.

The book starts with a provocative question: what will be in the humanity's agenda with having plague, war and famine under control? In other words, 21st century seems to be arguably the era where humanity no longer massively disappears from deadly diseases, starves to death, and triggers fierce wars. So what is the next project of humanity? What do we want to achieve next?

Immortality, bliss and divinity seem to be where humanity is planning to direct.

* Immortality: of course it is a deep instinct of each alive entity to strive for its life. What better if humans utilize technology to bring death under control? For millions of years death was considered inevitable and even something sacred. However, humanity in 21st century is casting question to this assumption. Is death just a technical problem? And can science resolve this?

* Divinity: the ability to manipulate everything is divinity according to the author. For example we want not only to be happy, but we want to rewire humans brains in a way that it experiences constant contentment. And not only for humans but also everything else, in the service of humans.

There is an interesting theory about religion, and how it evolved and changed with the lifestyle of humanity.

The author argues that hunter-gatherers were polytheist and all the creatures (e.g. animals, trees, rocks and etc.) in the nature had an equal role in humans minds. No superiority. A lion or tree would be as sacred as a human.

After agricultural revolution humans domesticated some animals and plants, hence humans believed that they stand in the superior positions, and nature and other species were silenced in newer religions such as Christianity. Now Homo Sapiens needed something greater than the surrounding domesticated nature, hence monotheism religions such as Christianity got more momentum. 

Since 500 years ago, with scientific revolution, humans are getting to know the universe better than before, hence in the new orchestra, God is also getting silenced. Humans become the only entities that stay on the stage.

The book finishes with how the humans may lose control over the world. The two major advantages of Humans are physical strength and intelligence. Once technology takes over in these two fields, wouldn't humans become inferior to computers and machines? The author argues that Liberalism may also collapse (because it relies on the fact that each person knows best for himself, while an machine/algorithm may do it actually better).

I think the author is too optimistic about humans scientific achievements and argues that it is difficult to imagine that humans will die in large magnitude due to some infectious diseases. Well, this is currently controversial (during COVID-19 pandemic).

I'd recommend this book if you are interested in political structures of the past and present (e.g. Capitalism, Communism and etc). Although I learned a lot from the book, reading this book was sometimes tedious and even difficult to follow for me.
