I liked this book, not because I have children and it helps me to treat them properly, but because it gives me the feeling that I'm connected with an inner voice of mine.

The most important takeaway that I got from "How to ... " is to first listen and then acknowledge the feeling of the child, then try to talk with the child (in a good time) and focus on the problem without blaming. Expressing the feelings to the children is totally fine as the child gets to know what his/her action has led to.

Problem-solving strategy is specially interesting, because it empowers the child to do the brainstorming for his/her other problems too.

I will use the methods of this book for my nephew and my niece :)
