The Phoenix Project is IT field's best practices to manage a team and a project, formulated as a narrative. The story is about Bill Palmer who gets promoted to VP IT Operations in the middle of a chaotic project—Project Phoenix—in Parts Unlimited company. The book portrays the efforts of Bill and his team in Operations department to save the company by managing the Phoenix Project properly.

Bill and his team bring ticketing system—Kanban board—to achieve transparency. So each time something crashes, they can track back to the root cause. Bill tries to understand how many ungoing projects the team has, while Phoenix is the most critical project and most of the resources must go Phoenix. Additionally, Bill tries to use his best resource—Brent—efficiently, so he decides that no other person shall ping Brent whenever they have a problem in their work. Instead, first they should go to another group of engineers, and only if they could not solve the severe problem, they shall contact Brent and document every single step that he does to solve the problem (so that the next time the team can solve the problem without Brent's help). Automation, automation and automation is a big lesson that Bill learns from Eric about being able to perform the deployment to the production environment. Finally he tries to establish a good communication with other parts of the company including Dev, Sales and etc. Therefore, he gets more feedback about what other departments really need.

What I liked about the book was that Bill always tries to establish a polite comminucation with others. Even when there are toxic people around him, he tries to focus on the job and not making the communication personal.

What I didn't like about the book was generally its topic: managing a project and other people. Maybe later in my life this becomes a more interesting topic to me.
