# The Pragmatic Programmer
Authors: David Thomas, Andrew Hunt

Date read: 2021-11-21

This is indeed a great book about almost all the aspects of software engineering, from improving individual developers—both soft and technical skills—, to making teams more successful.

The book starts off by laying the foundations of pragmatic programming mindset, continues with the principles of a good design, the basic tools that every programmer must have in their toolkit, concurrency, the best practices when you are coding and finishes by how to build a sophisticated team.

These are the pragmatic concepts that truly inspired me:

* It's your life, find a position that meets your desires.
* Taking responsibility about the mistakes and offering help instead of lame excuses.
* Knowledge portfolio: this is the biggest asset of a software developer. Hence, one must regularly invest in their knowledge portfolio. The author suggests learning one language a year, one technical book a month. Don't forget to diversify your skills.
* Communicate:
    * Plan what you intend to say in your presentation.
    * Choose your moment with the magic question: "Is this a good time to talk about ... ?"
    * Be listener: this is the only way people would listen to you.
    * Get back to people when you are busy or you want to think: "I'll get back to you later."
    * If you wouldn't say something to someone's face, don't say it online.
* DRY: the evils of duplication.
* Estimating: the unit of estimation matters. Also you need to take small steps with feedback.
* Plain text is quite powerful.
* A programmer should master: Version Control System, Shell, power editing (e.g. vim/emacs), skills to manipulate text.
* Listen to your lizard brain: if something is too difficult, something is not quite right because your lizard brain is desperately trying to tell you that.
* Fully understand customer's requirement by thinking about corner cases: think about the given statements of the customer, ask yourself why and go back with some questions to the customer. It's possible that you reshape the requirements.
* Programming by coincidence: fully be able to explain why your code works.
* Test ruthlessly: if you don't test your program, your customer will eventually find out. The most import aspect of unit-testing is the fact that it should make you THINK about the possible states of the program.

Specially I'm now more eager to invest more regularly in my technical "knowledge portfolio", as this is the greatest asset that we developers have. To start, I'm willing to leave my comfort zone with the programming languages that I know, and start learning new technologies; maybe Rust, Ruby and etc.

I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to flatten their "journey to mastery".
