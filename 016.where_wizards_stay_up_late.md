Where wizards stay up late is the story of how the Internet was originated, who contributed to it, and even the debates among supporters of different network ideas.

In 1960, the frustration of dealing with various computers with different hardware led the computer experts in Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) to invent a method to connect computers with different hardware together. They wanted the computers to be able to talk together regardless of their system configuration and hardware.

Before invention of the Internet, telephone companies such as AT&T had been utilizing a technique called circuit switching, so that customer A would be directly connected to customer B with a wire and thus a phone call would be feasible. This technique, could not have been applied to computers (because a computer could be connected to multiple nodes at the same time), therefore the experts came up with a new technique called packet switching. Packet switching meant that the information between two computers would be in the form of "packets" (and not all in one big chunk), and also it would be "switched" (just send the packet to the next dispatcher toward the destination).

Inventing the packet switching idea helped ARPA to create ARPANET by connecting a handful of universities in the US. At the same time, other experts in the US and also other countries started creating their own networks. Therefore, at that time there were multiple isolated networks, each having its own protocol, making it impossible to connect them together and create a bigger network.

In 1970s a protocol called TCP/IP was invented so that the idea of packet switching could be utilized in its optimal form. Gradually all the networks started to adopt TCP/IP and thus they could connect to other networks and create a bigger network, or as we know today the "Internet". So Internet is just a collection of some networks that could communicate via TCP/IP protocol.

The first 2/3rd of the book is extremely detailed and was even dull for me to follow. But all of a sudden the last third has a much faster pace which is more interesting to read, but also confusing for the reader (too much information in just a few pages).
