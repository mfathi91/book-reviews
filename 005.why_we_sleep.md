# Why We Sleep

Date read: 2021-08-22

It was ironic for me to learn how sleep can significantly change life, from reducing mortality rate to being happier, healthier and generally everything, according to Walker. The shocking aspect is how unknown sleep's vitality is, and how unaware we are. To be more precise, there is not only ignorance about significance of slumber, but also there are widely accepted myths in the society, such as "5 hours of sleep is enough", or "alcohol makes it easier to fall sleep", or "you can pay your sleep debt at the weekend if you sleep less during the week" and etc.

There are many interesting scientific facts in this book, which I enjoyed learning. For instance:

* Circadian: there is an internal clock which helps us the time internally. Circadian helps us to fall sleep (by Melatonin), when the time comes.

* REM and NREM sleep and their differences: REM helps to develop and wire the brain (hence infants and adolescents spend more time in REM sleep comparing to seniors). NREM helps the brain to become more agile and to solidify the memories. The analogy to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) company helps to understand this: at the beginning the ISP needs to build the infrastructure of the Internet, such as providing the cables in a neighborhood (this is REM stage wiring the brain), and then later on the ISP should optimize and balance the Internet usage of each house according to their usage (this is NREM stage where useless memories are forgotten and important memories are solidified).

* Dream: according to Walker, in REM stage we dream to remember, forget, and to be more creative (Mendeleev periodic table was invented in a dream for example).

* Sleep in teenagers: the brain of an adolescent becomes completely different and the circadian rhythm changes by 2 to 3 hours. Walker warns that the school time should begin later (e.g. to 9 AM) to allow the teenagers have their share of REM sleep in the morning.

* Sleep diseases: Insomnia (inability to fall sleep, given the opportunity) and Narcolepsy (overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden sleep attacks).

I will do the followings to improve my sleep:
* Sticking to a certain sleep schedule.
* Making the bedroom a bit cooler (~18 Celsius).
* Replacing the LEDs with other light bulbs in the bedroom.
* Reducing the lights a few hours before going to the bed.

To conclude, this book tells you—according scientific data—that sleep can boost your performance in any field that you can imagine.

Reading this book was a bit difficult for me and it took a long time to finish it, not because of being boring, but because of getting a bit nervous at night, during falling sleep.
