# Atomic Habits

Atomic Habits in a nutshell highlights the importance of small repeatitive tasks that make significant
results over time. In other words, the author explains atomic/small/tiny habits that we do, makes compound
effect over time and thus leads to significant results.

What I liked about the book was the folowings:
* the book focuses on the fact that habits and identity are not two different things. Habits actually ARE
our identity. As the book states: `The word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas,
which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your 'repeated being'.`
* the book underlines that there is no magic formula and one must fall in love with the boredom of repetitive
tasks to achieve one's goals.

What I didn't like about the book:
* I believe the book is too long, and there is just too much unnecessary chapters and techniques that are
explained.
* There are not a lot of science-backed claims in the book. It's mostly based on experience. I would've
prefered if the book had some scientific studies as well.

In general I would absolutely stick to having a habit tracker, and follow it as much as possible. That's it.
